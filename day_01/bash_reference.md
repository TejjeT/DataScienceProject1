Note- this is for `bash`, the standard shell used by Macs, Linux/Unix computers, and Git. Most of these commands won't work in a Windows DOS prompt (like PowerShell or the Anaconda Command Prompt).

# Glossary
- **directory**- another name for "folder"
- **file path**- the whole chain of directories that describes where a file is. Ex: `C:\Users\Brian\awesome.py`

# Essential Commands
- `pwd` - Print Working Directory, aka "Where am I?"
- `ls` - lists files in the current directory 
- `cd <place to navigate to>` - Change Directory, moves you into a new directory
- `mv <file> <new name/location>` - moves a file to a new location, like cut + paste. Can also be used to rename files.
- `cp <file> <new location>` - like `mv` but copies the file instead.
- `rm <file>` - permanent delete. Use caution! You'll need to add on the `-r` flag if you're deleting a directory.
- `mkdir <directory name>` - make a new directory

# Shorthand
- `.` - references the current directory.
- `..` - references the directory one level up from the current one. So `cd ..` moves you up to the parent directory from where you are.
